<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>Favourite hobbies include exercising, reading and spending time with family.</p>
<p>On an average week I wake up at 5am to exercise for 20 minutes and study, the week is then scheduled with 3 weight training sessions at the gym, 2 running sessions and a long yoga class. On rest days vegetating is prioritised.</p>
<p> Cooking is a favourite and finding recipes on Pinterest to cook for loved ones. Speciality being desserts.</p>
<p>Hiking has also always been part of the family since childhood and incorporating this is a monthly affair. </p>
