    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a second-year Computer Science student at IUBH Germany, currently supported by a BSc scholarship, and I hold a Data Science certificate from Explore AI Academy in South Africa. I am passionate about web development, with expertise in PHP, CSS, Java, JavaScript, and Python, and I enjoy studying Mathematics, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Programming Languages. In addition to my programming skills, I have certificates in SEO and Project Management, driven by a desire to understand the broader web landscape and excel in Agile project environments. My career began in Hospitality Management, where I earned honors from Tshwane University of Technology and gained global hotel experience, but I discovered my true passion in programming. Over the past two years, I have worked as a Wordpress and Shopify developer and am now eager to advance into full-stack development. </p>
    <p>In my free time I like spending time with my family and exercising. Read more about my hobbies <a href="Hobbies.html">here.</a></p>
